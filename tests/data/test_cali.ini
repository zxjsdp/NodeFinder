#
#    Add multiple calibration infomations (e.g.: '>0.06<0.08') to the most
#    recent common node of the two species names given by user in each line.
#
#    [ATTENTION]:
#
#        Please Check the result VERY CAREFULLY by visual softwares like
#        TreeView. This software will not fit some of the extreme conditions.
#
#    [Usage]:
#
#        Please input some necessary informations in calibration.ini file:
#
#            1. Tree file (Newick format) name or path
#            2. name_a, name_b, calibration_infomation_1
#            3. name_c, name_d, calibration_infomation_2
#            4. ...
#
#        [Tips]:
#
#            1. Lines in ini file that contains only blanks will be ignored.
#            2. Lines starts with "#" or "//" will be considered as comment
#               line and ignored.
#            3. Multiple calibration informations can be added to ini file at
#               the same time, each in a line.
#            4. For calibration information lines, name_a, name_b, and
#               calibration_infomation can be separated by "," or ";" or
#               blanks. "," are recommended.
#            5. Separators in each line must be CONSISTENT.
#
#
#        [For example]:
#
#            We have this tree file: "test.nwk".
#                ((a ,((b, c), (d, e))), (f, g));
#
#            Modify calibration.ini to make it like this:
#            (Comments can be kept there)
#
#                test.nwk
#
#                c, b, >0.05<0.07
#                a, e, >0.04<0.06
#                c, f, >0.3<0.5
#
#            Outcome:
#                ((((a, b), c)>0.05<0.07, (d, e))>0.04<0.06, (f, g))>0.3<0.5;
#
#            And a file named "test.calibration.nwk" will be genereated.
#
#            PLEASE USE SOFTWARES LIKE TreeView TO CHECK THE OUTCOME!!
